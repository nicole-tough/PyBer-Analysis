# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes data from Pyber, a ride sharing company valued at $2.3 billion. In this project, we analyzed data from January 2019 to early May of 2019 to create visualizations of fare prices in multiple city types. We sorted data by city types urban, suburban, and rural. Ultimately, we created a multiple line graph showing the total weekly fares for each city type. At the end of our analysis, we will provide a summary of how the fares differ by city type and recommendations on how these differences can be used by decision makers. 

## Results
As seen in the chart below, there is a significant difference between the data from each city type. Compared to number of rides in rural cities, there are 5x as many rides and 13x as many rides in suburban and urban cities respectively. This results in suburban cities having nearly 4.5x the amount of total fares compared to rural cities and urban cities having 9.2x the amount of total fares compared to rural cities. These results indicate that there is not an equal correlation between number of rides and fare of each ride. This is also reflected in the average fare per ride for each city type. On average, riders in a rural city is paying nearly $3.50 more per ride and $10 more per ride compared to fellow riders in suburban and urban cities. 

## Summary
With this analysis in mind, we would like to provide the following recommendations to decision makers at Pyber:

- Incentivize riders in suburban and rural cities: Data shows that the more rides taking place in a city reduces the fare of each ride. This creates a disadvantage for riders in suburban and rural cities where less rides are taking place. They can be incentivized to ride more with promotion codes or discounts to make the fare of their rides more equitable with riders in urban cities. 

- Incentivize drivers in suburban and rural cities: Our data indicates that having more drivers in any given city will reduce the fare of each ride. By increasing the number of drivers

- Monitor summer ride sharing usage: In the beginning of May, the total fare drops in all city types. We recommend that decision makers at Pyber look into reasons why this drop took place and monitor if it continues throughout the summer. There may be a connection between time of year, season, or weather that is affecting the number of rides and total fares. If so, further recommendations can be made to increase total rides throughout the entire year.
